# Cipher

Implementation of the _Caesar_ cipher and its two variations _Rot13_ and _Vigenere_. The performance of each of the ciphers is checked by using unit testing.

The tests are run by the command: `python -m unittest -v`. Two tests are performed for each cipher. One checks the encryption, and the other checks the decryption accuracy.
